# karma-oojspec
A tentative to integrate karma with [oojspec](https://github.com/rosenfeld/oojspec/)

For now we use a modified [karma](https://github.com/fredericoschardong/karma) while pull request [1825](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma/pull/1825) is not accepted.

## Install the dependencies

    npm install

## Running

    karma start

# TODO

* ~~Make oojspec results be displayed in Karma's console~~
* Turn this into a plugin (we have to wait until oojspec becomes a npm package itself)
